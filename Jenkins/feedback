As i said Today is my last day and before leaving this organisation i want to share my overall experience working with Swapnil yeole and hope it help others as well who will be going to work under him in the future. So today I don’t have any fear to share this with you because earlier i was in fear to share this feedback if swapnil comes to know about this then there was a high number of chance he might have take any actions against me in any way like in terms of work or reporting or in appraisal time because his nature is revengeful which i have experienced earlier at the time of abhishek maurya incident. I would simply says he has no manager qualities and he doesn’t know how to manage team as a manager. He still have many things to learn as a manager because whoever person  who worked under him earlier if you ask them then they will simply deny to work  with him again in future. He has that much toxicity and doesn’t respect his junior and doesn’t appreciate good work and gets all of their credits without doing nothing. He has done this things many time he came in the morning he was check in and went away all the day without informing to us and ultimately we two were handle client side most of the part in his absence and due to this we have got many escalations in projects but no one has told you about this,even sandeep in avanse and at the time of bfsl project there was a project manager named milind they both knows his working capability and his way of working but they both were only supported swapnil they hide many things about him. Swapnil is having more than 5 years of experience but still he is not good in aws and we never got a clarity most of time what we are doing in this project and how things are going, most of the time he skipped alot things by saying you guys are senior find it by urself rather than explaining the issue. At the initial time of avanse project he was given abhishek maurya’s responsibility on me because he was fresher at that time but as a manager your responsibility is to train every resources who works under you with your knowledge and guidance but he had given me his responsibility and strictly warned me that now ownwards he won’t deal with this fresher  this is all my responsibility if anything done wrong from his side i will be the responsible person likewise he said. Including me we 3 are terminated from this organisation whose worked under him, one is me another is vyankatesh valtair and third one you know very well who is amrita namdev, although she had her personal family issue but she told me before leaving this organisation that her working experience under swapnil as a lead was very poor and this was also one of the main reasons for her to left the organisation and many times she cried on a personal call because of swapnil toxic work culture.
There are many more things to tell about swapnil’s behaviour and bad working experience under him as a team member but one request from you please take necessary action against him so that if any persons like me to improve himself and require any helps from the lead so he/she should ask and get their doubt clear without any hesitate, with proper knowledge and works freely in team environment.
